Advent of Code 2020
===

My solutions for [Advent of Code 2020](https://adventofcode.com/2020). If you view the code, I hope you are more edified than horrified. The coding style is mostly quick and dirty. Any deviations from that style are due to either frustration or to making myself feel more clever. Enter at your own risk.

## Dependencies

As far as I remember, I've stuck to the standard library plus `numpy`. (Arrays are so darn useful.) Also, assume this only works with `python >= 3.6`. The `print()` usage will be broken in `2.x` and I can't be bothered to test with anything but the version that came with the OS.

## Running

To get one of the solutions `cd DayXX/python`, then execute `python dayX.py first` to see the first solution for a day or `python dayX.py second` to get the solution for the second part.
